# openstack_project
This project aims to deploy and operate a service within an OpenStack Cloud while evaluating its performance under varying conditions. It involves creating a solution that deploys and manages the service using OpenStack, automation, and monitoring tools.

The project consists of two main parts:

1.Software Solution: This part focuses on developing a solution that deploys, operates, and cleans up the service within an OpenStack Cloud. It includes three         operating modes: deployment, operations, and cleanup. The solution creates networks, routers, nodes, and other necessary components during deployment. It monitors   the number of nodes, adds or removes nodes based on availability, and releases allocated cloud resources during cleanup.

2.Report: The report provides a comprehensive overview of the design, performance evaluation, and scalability considerations. It includes three sections: description   of the design, performance evaluation using Apache Benchmark, and reasoning about managing the solution at a large scale.
